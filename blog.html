                    <h2>Our Certificates, Qualifications, & Licenses</h2>
                    <p>At Media Wine & Spirits #2, we take our commitment to 
                    responsible alcohol retailing very seriously. We believe 
                    that ensuring the safe and responsible sale of alcoholic 
                    beverages is not just a legal obligation but a moral one, 
                    and it's a responsibility that extends to every member of 
                    our team.
                    </p>
                <br>
                    <p>To uphold the highest standards of safety and legality, every 
                    individual working at our liquor store undergoes comprehensive 
                    certification and training. This training equips our staff with 
                    the knowledge and skills necessary to navigate the complexities of 
                    alcohol regulations, promote responsible consumption, and prevent 
                    the sale of alcohol to minors or individuals who are already intoxicated.
                    </p>
                <br>
                    <p>Our team members are certified in accordance with local and national 
                    regulations, and they regularly update their knowledge to stay current 
                    with any changes in the industry. We understand that the sale of alcohol 
                    carries significant social and health responsibilities, and we are committed 
                    to playing our part in promoting safe and responsible drinking habits within 
                    our community.
                    </p>
